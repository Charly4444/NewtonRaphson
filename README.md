# NewtonRaphson
The NR method is a Numerical Computing technique that relies on the famous iteration formula of Newton-Raphson to provide solution to equations
This code implements the NR-method and with various checks in place:
After recieving end user inputs and initializing variables, The next sections:
(i) Evaluate f(x) and f'(x) in a try-except block, this is because some functions can be ill-defined at certain points
(ii) For valid results obtained in the earlier step, the NR formula is evaluated for the iteration and
results presented based on conditions.

#The EFFICIENT use of this program REQUIRES that
1) the user knows about polynomial functions and 
2) the user knows to differentiate a polynomial function as most other functions may not be easily solved with this program
3) finally though not compulsory, a prior knowledge of the function can help the user make good initial guesses and
   improve the program performance
